  <h1>Architecture Project Portfolio</h1>

  <p>This portfolio showcases a growing collection of architecture-led projects Iâ€™ve designed and delivered. These projects tackle hard problems in data integration, compliance, auditability, and scalability using pragmatic patterns rooted in SQL Server, enterprise messaging, and clean design.</p>

  <p>Each write-up walks through not just what was built, but why it was built that wayâ€”highlighting design trade-offs, system constraints, and lessons learned. If you're a systems architect, engineering leader, or technologist dealing with similar challenges, I hope youâ€™ll find these valuable.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ“Œ Project 1: SQL Server EventStream</h2>

  <p><strong>EventStream</strong> transforms SQL Server into the system of record for structured change events. It replaces audit tables with an event-driven model using:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Triggers + Service Broker</strong> to emit immutable change events</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic code generation</strong> tied to schema evolution</li>
    <li><strong>Reliable delivery</strong> of events to downstream consumers</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>High-integrity audit trail</li>
    <li>Loose coupling between source and consumers</li>
    <li>Zero external dependencies</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ðŸ“Œ Project 2: Rethinking Restrictions</h2>

  <p><strong>Rethinking Restrictions</strong> reimagines how dynamic business rulesâ€”especially in complianceâ€”are modeled and executed. Instead of hard-coding restrictions into relational logic, it proposes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>normalized rules engine</strong> based on data, not logic</li>
    <li>A Google Mapsâ€“inspired metaphor to separate <em>rules</em> from <em>routes</em></li>
    <li>Support for layered, reusable rule composition</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Traditional schemas struggle with overlapping and temporal logic</li>
    <li>This model allows traceable, versioned evaluation paths</li>
    <li>Integrates seamlessly with event-driven architectures</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ðŸ“Œ Project 3: Project Yellow</h2>

  <p><strong>Project Yellow</strong> addresses the often-neglected problem of enterprise reference data. Itâ€™s a deep dive into what reference data is, why it breaks systems, and how to manage it across silos.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Defines a <strong>taxonomy for reference data types</strong> and lifecycles</li>
    <li>Highlights real-world causes of drift, ambiguity, and misuse</li>
    <li>Proposes a <strong>centralized stewardship pattern</strong> without bottlenecks</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Use Cases</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cross-system reconciliation in regulated environments</li>
    <li>Eliminating hard-coded lists, constants, and lookups</li>
    <li>Making reference data a first-class citizen in your architecture</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ðŸ“Œ Project 4: Glue Deployments</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Glue Deployments</strong> showcases a fully automated CI/CD framework for AWS Glue built before native tooling had matured. It enabled a team of data engineers to deploy Spark-based ETL jobs safely and consistently using:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>CodeCommit and CodeBuild for versioned deployment pipelines</li>
    <li>Parameter Store and CloudFormation for secure, repeatable releases</li>
    <li>Schema-aware validation with rollback support built in</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Why It Matters</h4>
  <p>
    At the time, AWS Glue lacked built-in support for promoting jobs between environments. This framework filled that gap, enforcing standards, reducing manual effort, and letting developers ship faster with confidence. It laid the groundwork for platform engineering practices in serverless data lakes.

  <h2>ðŸš€ Why These Projects?</h2>

  <p>These arenâ€™t academic prototypesâ€”they were developed to solve problems inside banks, fintechs, and regulated platforms. Together, they form a growing toolkit for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Making compliance traceable and explainable</li>
    <li>Improving audit and observability across systems</li>
    <li>Reducing integration friction via clean, event-driven boundaries</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you're navigating the architectural challenges of enterprise modernizationâ€”especially in data-heavy, regulated contextsâ€”these case studies are built for you.</p>
