# SQL Server EventStream

A centralized, event-driven architecture for capturing and streaming row-level changes in SQL Serverâ€”built to replace a legacy history-tracking database with a robust, scalable solution that integrates seamlessly with downstream systems.

## Overview

This project presents a novel architectural pattern that turns Microsoft SQL Server into the authoritative event source for an enterprise platform. By leveraging native features such as triggers, stored procedures, and Service Broker, it delivers:

- **Immutable event capture** for every insert, update, and delete
- **Schema evolution support** through automatic code generation
- **Loose coupling** between systems via queues and event consumers
- **End-to-end traceability** of data changes across the estate

The solution addresses the challenges of auditing, replication, and integration by transforming operational database changes into structured eventsâ€”offering a practical alternative to both Change Data Capture (CDC) and third-party pipelines.

## What's Inside

The GitHub Pages site linked above includes:

- A full walkthrough of the architectural design
- Diagrams illustrating event propagation and message flow
- Code samples demonstrating how events are captured and consumed
- A discussion of trade-offs and lessons learned

## Use Cases

- Replacing legacy audit or history tables
- Building an event backbone without introducing Kafka or Debezium
- Creating extensible integration patterns for financial systems

If you're evaluating event streaming within a SQL Server environmentâ€”whether for compliance, analytics, or microservices integrationâ€”this project is a compelling reference implementation.
